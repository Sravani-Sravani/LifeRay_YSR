			<p>Government has been operationalizing Comprehensive Financial Management System (CFMS) which will usher in automation of all government processes relating to preparation of budget, release of funds, incurring of expenditure, processing of bills by the DDOs and the Treasuries, preparation of accounts, maintenance of electronic data etc. The Human Resources management System (HRMS) is also included in the CFMS Project, and the HRMS component will automate all processes relating to the entire gamut of monetary and non-monetary entitlements of the employees. In that context Government issued orders in G.O.Ms.334, Finance (SMPC-II) Department, dated: 13.12.2013 directing all the DDOs in the State , to collect the data of all Government Employees online through web based application established by the Finance department portal in order to implement HRMS and issue of Health Cards.</p>
			<p>The data furnished as above by the DDOs is being made available to the AHCT by the Finance Department for issue of health cards to the employees and their dependent family members.</p>
			<p>During scrutiny of the data, it has been observed that some employees have not uploaded photographs of ‘self' and ‘dependents'. Such employees can login into the web portal <span style="color:#0000FF;">www.ehs.ap.gov.in/EHSAP</span> using their employee ID as ‘user ID', and the same user-ID as first time password, in order to upload photographs.</p>
			<p>The system also allows the employees to update dependent family members. The procedure for updation of family members is as indicated below:</p>
