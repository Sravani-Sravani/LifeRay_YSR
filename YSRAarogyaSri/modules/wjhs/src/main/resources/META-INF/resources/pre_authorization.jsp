                        case solely rests with the
                        treating doctor and the NWH. The pre-authorization remarks of panel doctor or Dr.YSR
                        Aarogyasri shall be construed as advisory in nature and shall not in any way alter
                        the line of treatment proposed by the treating doctor.</li>

                        financial assistance under the scheme and shall not be construed as an endorsement
                        of treatment by the NWH.</li>
