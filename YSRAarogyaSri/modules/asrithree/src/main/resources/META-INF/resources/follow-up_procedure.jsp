Presently Trust is providing follow-up drugs to these beneficiaries through Network Hospitals, but changes in the follow-up services are required in order to streamline the services. </p> 
					<p> Hence the technical committee of the Trust in consultation with specialists identified specific procedures for follow-up, reviewed the present policy and suggested change by providing system / disease specific package.
