Towards achievement of universal health coverage for BPL families whether defined in terms of financial protection or access to and effective use of health care, Government of Andhra Pradesh is implementing state sponsored Dr.YSR Aarogyasri Health Insurance Scheme. This scheme certainly counts to be one of the pioneers in terms of achieving equity and providing accountable and evidence-based good-quality health-care services in the state to assist poor families from catastrophic health expenditure. The aim of the Government is to provide Universal Health Coverage to BPL families. The scheme is a unique PPP model in the field of Health Insurance, tailor made to the health needs of poor patients and provides end-to-end cashless services for identified diseases under secondary and tertiary care through a network of service providers from Government and private sector.
 

The scheme has established a demand-side mechanism that mobilizes and channels additional public financing to health, introduced an explicit benefits package, pioneered cashless care and fostered public private partnerships.
 

The scheme is designed in such a way that the benefit in the primary care is addressed through free screening and outpatient consultation both in the health camps and in the network hospitals as part of scheme implementation. The IEC activity during the health camps, screening, counselling and treatment of common ailments in the health camps and out-patient services in network hospitals is supplementing the government health care system in preventive and primary care.
 

In order to facilitate the effective implementation of the scheme, the State Government set up the Dr.YSR Aarogyasri Health Care Trust, under the chairmanship of the Honorable Chief Minister. The Trust is administered by a Chief Executive Officer who is an IAS Officer. The trust, in consultation with the specialists in the field of insurance and healthcare, runs the scheme.
 

Dr.YSR Aarogyasri Health Insurance scheme is unique in its applicability since no other State/ government agency has provided universal health coverage to the poor. The choice of hospital for treatment is with the patient. The entire process from the time of conduct of health camps to the screening, diagnosing , treatment, follow- up and claim payment is made transparent through online web based processing to prevent any misuse and fraud. The scheme is complimentary to facilities available in government hospitals and put together provides Universal Health Coverage to BPL population including Prevention, Primary care and In-Patient care. All the Primary Health Centres (PHCs) which are the first contact point, Area/District Hospitals and Network Hospitals, are provided with Help Desks manned by VAIDYA MITHRA's to facilitate the illiterate patients.

Impact on Health Scenario in the State

i) Changing Tertiary care profile As the scheme progressed the pre-existing load of diseases is coming down, particularly in relation to the high end diseases in cardiology, neurosurgery, gynaecology and obstetrics etc., This may be attributed to the decrease in preload which is contributed by procedures under the scheme such as valve replacement surgeries and congenital cardiac defects, SOLs in brain and chronic disorders in gynaecology.
 

ii) Improvement in documentation and regulatory effect on Hospitals The empanelment procedure, defined diagnostic and treatment protocols, capturing of admission notes, daily clinical notes, operation notes, discharge summary and uploading of diagnostic reports including films, WebEx recording of Angio and Laparoscopic procedures and other photographic evidences have resulted in profound improvement of medical documentation in the State and regulatory effect on the hospitals.
 

iii) Improvement in quality of services: Continued monitoring of the services both online and in the field by the elaborated field mechanism coupled with disciplinary action against erring hospitals is greatly contributing to the quality of treatment under the scheme.
 

iv) Establishing Medical Protocols tailor-made to local situations: The scheme by taking into consideration of availability of local infrastructure and standard medical practices defined standard medical protocols with the help of senior specialists in each field.
 

v) Employment Generation The scheme generated indirect employment potential as the insurance company, network hospital and other stake holders have to employ number of people in different cadres such as Vaidyamithra, MEDCO, VMCCO, duty doctors, para medical technicians, staff nurses etc.,
 

vi) Health Awareness: Since implementation of the scheme Health camps held in rural areas not only screened people but also played key role in bringing health awareness among the population through IEC activity. Counselling by field staff and paramedical staff is also contributing to the health awareness among rural poor. As pre-evaluation of the patient is also cashless under the scheme, the people are motivated to approach network hospitals as and when suspected of suffering from identified diseases.
 

vii) Morbidity pool and Disease Mapping As the entire patient data of people attending health camps, network hospital OP, in-patient treatment details and treatment details of the beneficiaries approved under the scheme are captured online, it created huge morbidity data of the population.
 

viii) Early recognition and Disease IEC activities, health camps, counselling by field staff and awareness campaigns by the Trust and district administration is helping in early recognition and disease prevention.
 

ix) Performance of Government Hospitals Hospitals from Govt sector with requisite infrastructure are empanelled to provide services under the scheme and they are entitled to receive same payment as the private and corporate hospitals. This is helping Govt.,hospitals to earn much needed finances for improving infrastructure, provide quality care to the patients This system is motivating more and more government hospitals to participate in the scheme and utilize the revenue earned to improve facilities to provide quality medical care. Government decided to retain 20% of earnings by the Government Hospitals to create revolving fund to regularly assist these hospitals to improve their infrastructure and decided to utilize art thus bring reforms in tertiary medical care
 

x) Other PPP models Dr.YSR Aarogyasri Health Insurance scheme has encouraged the introduction of many successful PPP schemes as given below.
